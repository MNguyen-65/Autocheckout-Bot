# Autocheckout-Bot
The bot will take in your information (par credit card number and CVV) and will checkout a specified item from supremenewyork.com. This is solely for demonstration and educational purposes.
This bot was developed with selenium, chrome drivers, web drivers, webdriver ui, time, and a few other, peripheral packages.
The bot supports IP authenticated proxies and user pass proxies (make sure to follow the prompts correctly)
Code currently uses xpath identifiers, but will soon support headless browser instances and be more fault tolerant
If you have any issues, please let me know and I will iron them out!
